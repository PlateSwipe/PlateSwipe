# PlateSwipe

## Project Description
PlateSwipe is designed for busy professionals, health-conscious individuals and those who struggle to find time and inspiration to cook healthy meals, often resorting to ultra-processed foods. Our app offers a personalized, swipe-based recipe discovery experience, tailored to users' preferences like budget, dietary needs, and cultural tastes.

The insight behind our solution is that cooking at home should be enjoyable and convenient. The **Virtual Fridge** feature allows users to import their grocery list, which helps them keep track of what ingredients they have on hand. While users can discover a wide variety of recipes—some of which may not require any of their current ingredients—this feature assists in making informed choices when viewing recipes. Users can see what they already possess, along with the average cost of each recipe, making meal planning easier and reducing food waste. We target young professionals who value convenience and health, busy parents looking for quick meal solutions, and food enthusiasts eager to explore diverse culinary options without the hassle.

## Technologies Used
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure and hassle-free user sign-in for access to personalized data across multiple devices.
- **Firebase Firestore**: Primary database for storing user profiles, favorite recipes, and the contents of the virtual fridge.
- **Firebase Storage**: Handles the storage of images related to the virtual fridge, allowing users to keep a visual inventory of their ingredients.
- **Google Maps API**: Offers location-based food recommendations, connecting users to nearby markets and promoting the use of fresh, local ingredients.
- **Offline Mode**: Users can access and view downloaded recipes, create and manage grocery lists, and explore saved content without an internet connection.
- **Barcode Scanning**: Users can scan the barcode of ingredients to easily fill their virtual fridge.

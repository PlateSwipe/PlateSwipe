## Project Description
PlateSwipe is designed for busy professionals, health-conscious individuals and those who struggle to find time and inspiration to cook healthy meals, often resorting to ultra-processed foods. Our app offers a personalized, swipe-based recipe discovery experience, tailored to users' preferences like budget, dietary needs, and cultural tastes.

The insight behind our solution is that cooking at home should be enjoyable and convenient. The **Virtual Fridge** feature allows users to import their grocery list, which helps them keep track of what ingredients they have on hand. While users can discover a wide variety of recipes—some of which may not require any of their current ingredients—this feature assists in making informed choices when viewing recipes. Users can see what they already possess, making meal planning easier and reducing food waste. We target young professionals who value convenience and health, busy parents looking for quick meal solutions, and food enthusiasts eager to explore diverse culinary options without the hassle.

## Technologies Used
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure and hassle-free user sign-in for access to personalized data across multiple devices.
- **Firebase Firestore**: Primary database for storing user profiles, recipes, and ingredient.
- **Firebase Storage**: Handles the storage of images related to the recipe and the ingredient.
- **Offline Mode**: Users can access and view downloaded recipes and their virtual fridge.
- **Barcode Scanning**: Users can scan the barcode of ingredients to easily fill their virtual fridge.

## Usage Instructions
- Launch the app and sign in using Google Authentication.
- Fill your virtual fridge by scanning barcodes or manually entering ingredients.
- Explore recipes tailored to your preferences, regardless of your fridge contents.

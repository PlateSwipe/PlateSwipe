# SwEnt Milestone 1 Feedback

This first milestone M1 serves as a checkpoint at which we provide you with formal feedback on how you are coming together as a team, organizing yourselves, adopting good software engineering practices, and making progress toward delivering incremental value to your users. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The goal of our evaluation is not to assess whether you are top-tier Android developers or software testers, this will be assessed in earnest in subsequent milestones, once you've had the opportunity to gain experience and acquire the relevant skills. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M1 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M1.md) document.

We looked at several aspects, grouped into three categories: app design, app quality & delivery, and Scrum.

- [App Design](#app-design)

  - [Architecture](#architecture)

  - [Implementation](#implementation)

  - [Figma](#figma)

  - [UI](#ui)

- [Scrum](#scrum)

  - [Documents](#documents)

# App Design

## Architecture

We looked at the high-level design of your app. We checked whether the UI, data layer, and corresponding dependencies are present. We evaluated whether your architecture diagram is of good quality and reflects the architecture of the app.

The UI layer, the data layer are present and the dependencies make sense.
The architecture diagram is really clear.

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 5.

## Implementation

We looked at several implementation aspects, such as whether authentication is done safely, whether all sensitive data is properly safeguarded using crypto and secure APIs, and whether the permissions requested by your app are truly needed.

You did things the standard and right way.
All sensitive data properly safeguarded using crypto, secure APIs, etc.
Requested permissions are truly needed.

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 5.

## Figma

We reviewed how you used Figma in these first Sprints of your project. We took into account whether you had done wireframes and mockups, whether these contained the main application flows and the core features, and whether the screens were linked. Overall, we wanted to see whether it's clear how the pieces work together.

The wireframe is pretty much already the figma. You don't need to put that much effiorts into the it. The wireframe just cares about the interactions between the screens, the logic, the buttons and components locations. Then having that we can design the UI in the figma.
But the Wireframe and Mockup contain all the main applications flows and the core feature of the app.
A few buttons are not linked in in the Mockup but the important things of the M1 deliverable are here.

For this part, you received 14 points out of a maximum of 15.

## UI

We checked whether the elements of your app's UI are consistent (fonts, colors, etc.) and whether the layout is responsive (i.e., adapts to different screen sizes and orientations).

UI elements are consistent throughout the app.
However, in the swipe page, we lose access to the description and grade of the reciepe when going into landscape mode. You could make it responsive or could block the app in portrait mode.

For this part, you received 3 points out of a maximum of 5.

# Quality & Delivery

## Automated Testing

We looked at whether you configured your CI to integrate with Sonar, whether your CI passes, and of course whether your CI automatically runs the test suite. Then we checked the statement coverage achieved by your test suite. We also looked at whether you have at least one meaningful UI test per screen, one meaningful unit test per repository, one meaningful unit test per view-model, and one meaningful end-to-end test.

The CI is configured to run Sonar.
The CI passes on main except for the APK build action.
The CI runs the tests, and we have access to the coverage on Sonar Cloud.
You have 80% line coverage.
But, There is no end to end test going through a full user flow of the app.

For this part, you received 27 points out of a maximum of 33.

## Automated Delivery

We checked whether you have set up your CI to automatically build the APK, and it does so successfully. We also wanted to see if the APK could be installed and run on a real device.

The APK wasn't building successfully in main and you didn't have a release branch / official release build in you wiki.
But we saw that there was a branch with a successful APK build action and the APK was working when tested on a real device.

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 7.

## End-to-End Application Behavior

We then interacted with your app manually, this was fun. We flagged any problems we encountered, such as crashes or bugs, and we classified the bugs into minor vs. major bugs.

We didn't encounter any crash or bug when testing your app except for the landscape mode, but that was already penalized in the UI part.

For this part, you have been penalized 0 points.

# Scrum

## Documents

The main things we looked for was whether you documented your team Retrospective and Stand-Up in a timely and thorough manner.

The standup document is good enough for M1, try to have them fully filled out before the meeting so you already know what you're going to tell during the meeting for next sprints.
Some sheets were filled with minimal report but most of it was meaningful.

For this part, you received 9 points out of a maximum of 10.

## Backlogs & Planning

We analyzed your product backlog, Sprint 3 backlog, and the Scrum board. For the PB, we checked whether it was up-to-date and whether you had populated it with user stories for the first epic and for a second epic. For the Sprint 3 backlog, we looked at whether it was up-to-date and whether the task descriptions were clear. We looked at whether tasks were assigned, whether they had a time estimate, and whether they had a priority. Finally, we evaluated whether your
Scrum board was up-to-date and ready for Sprint 3.

The Product backlog is up to date.
There are two tasks that are classified for sprint 2 in the sprint backlog. I think you just forgot to update the sprint for them. 

You can add labels for sprints so you could easily see the sprint for a task on the global board.

The user stories are great.
The organization in the sections "Done" and "Done PRs" is really good.

There are a few tasks in "In Development" without being linked to a PR or having any information on what's going on, we won't allow that in M2.

We can't understand really easily what's going on when just looking at the sprint board. You can improve on clarity. Try to have more descriptive names for the tasks, not just one word. It's good that you sometimes give a description in the tasks that need it, you can do it more.
All members have tasks assigned in the Sprint 3 backlog

For this part, you received 17 points out of a maximum of 20.

Based on the above points, your intermediate grade for this milestone M1 is 5.30. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/private/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Good luck for the next Sprints!
